# KN07: Kubernetes II

## A) Begriffe und Konzepte erlernen (40%)

### Pods vs Replicas

Pods are the smallest and most basic unit which can be deployed in kubernetes. A Pod is similar to a capusule
containing one or more docker containers, which are tightly coupled and share ressources. When a Pod crashes or dies, it's completely gone. 

Replicas aren't standalone units like Pods, but rather a Replicaset. Replicasets ensure that there are enought Pod replicas 
running at all times. If a Pod in a Replicaset dies, the Replicaset automatically creates new Pod to mantain the needed amount. 

### Service vs Deployment

Deployment describes how your app should be deployed. It defines which container image to use, how many replicas of app shoould run, and how updates should be handled. 

Service is a way to expose groups of pods. Service provides a stable IP address and a DNS name for a group of pods. It is like a load balancer, routing traffic to the runnnig to the running pods that belong to that service. 

### Ingress

It solves the problem of external access to services within a cluster. Without Ingress, you would have to configure seperate load balanders for each service which you want to expose externally. 
It acts as a intellifgent reverse Proxy or API gateway for HTTP and HTTPS traffic. 

### StatefulSet

It is a controller specifically for managing stateful applications. The provide stable, unique network identities, persisten storage and deployment and scaling for its pods. 
It ensures that Pods, even if restarted or rescheduled, retain their identity and their associated storage. 

A messaging platform such as Apache Kafka, for example, requires fixed IDs for its broker nodes so that messages are processed correctly. A stateful set ensures that each broker retains its specific role in the cluster.

### Mongo URL

````bash
mongodb://mongo-user:password@mongo-service:27017
````

Kubernetes service names within the cluster act as DNS names and pods can reach the service using this name.

This eliminates the need to use fixed IPs that can change.

Port 27017 is the default port for MongoDB, which is forwarded by the service.

### Difference betweeen webapp- and mongo-service

#### Describe webapp-service command

#### Describe mongo-service command

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3fed2ce-fbd5-4a6f-860a-737ae60d01e9)

Differences between mongo-service and webapp-service:

The webapp service is exposed as a NodePort, i.e. has external ports and endpoints visible.

The mongo service is typically a ClusterIP service, i.e. only accessible within the cluster, no external ports.

The Mongo service is not accessible from the outside because the database is only intended for internal communication. However, the web app requires external access, hence NodePort.

Explanation: 
<br>
I have exposed the webapp service as a NodePort service. Minikube maps this port to an IP of the cluster that is accessible from all nodes. This allows me to access the webapp on different nodes via NodeIP+Port.

## Connect to MongoDB Compass 

The connection does not work because the mongo service is defined as a cluster IP and can therefore only be reached in the Kubernetes cluster, but not from outside. To change that you can forward the port so that you be able to access is from outside the container.

### Change Node port in webapp to 32000 

When changing the webapp-deployment.yaml you have to change the port from 30100 to 32000 in the NodePort Secrion. Where the replica tags are you have to change it from 1 to 3 so that there are 3 replicas created by the webapp pod.
